This is my clone of the Easybank landing page from Frontend Mentor challenge.

It primarily consist of HTML5, CSS (using flexbox and the grid system) and Vanilla JS.

The hamburger menu were the main source of JavaScript - both on the mobile and tablet views.

No frontend frameworks were used during this project and this ended up being a pure "look and recreate" task - i.e. for 99% of this job I refrained from looking at the dev tools on the original website to make this a difficult challenge.

On completion I was very happy with this outcome.
